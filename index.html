              Conducted a comprehensive analysis of New York City's Citi Bike
              system to uncover trends in rider behavior based on
              <strong>age, gender, and trip location</strong>. Leveraged
              <strong>Excel</strong> for data cleaning and preparation, then
              built dynamic, interactive dashboards in
              <strong>Tableau</strong> to bring the insights to life.

                <strong>Rider Demographics:</strong> Visualized ridership

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Station-Level Insights:</strong> Mapped high-traffic

              <li>
                <strong>Interactive Filters:</strong> Enabled end-users to

              Performed an in-depth analysis of pharmaceutical data to evaluate
              the effectiveness of potential treatments for
              <strong>Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)</strong>, a common type of
              skin cancer. The study involved 250 mice treated with various drug
              regimens over a 45-day period. Using <strong>Python</strong> and
              data visualization libraries, I tracked and analyzed tumor
              response, survival rates, and metastatic progression.

              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Overall Effectiveness:</strong> Built a comparative bar
                chart of total percent change in tumor volume across all

                Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo.

              This research project involved analyzing corporate employee data
              from the 1980s and 1990s using six CSV files that represent the
              remaining fragments of an old employee database. I reconstructed
              the entire relational database structure using
              <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, then performed data modeling,
              engineering, and analysis to extract meaningful insights.
            </p>
            <h4>🔧 Data Modeling</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Inspected the structure of all CSVs and designed an Entity
                Relationship Diagram (ERD).
              </li>
              <li>
                Used tools such as
                <a href="http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com" target="_blank"
                  >QuickDatabaseDiagrams</a
                >
                to visualize table relationships.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>🛠️ Data Engineering</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Defined a normalized schema including primary keys, foreign
                keys, and data constraints for all six CSVs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Imported all CSV data into their respective SQL tables in a
                PostgreSQL database.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>📊 Data Analysis</h4>
            <p>
              Once the database was complete, I executed various SQL queries to
              answer complex business questions such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>List employee details like number, name, sex, and salary.</li>
              <li>Find employees hired in 1986.</li>
              <li>
                Identify department managers along with their departments.
              </li>
